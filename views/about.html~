<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is Carl. I created the AtheistEngineer pseudonym to keep religion and politics 
off my main social media pages.  My identity is only quasi-secret. My goal is to remain
just anonymous enough to keep this material from showing up in search results  
if a potential Christian or Republican employer searches the internet for my name.
</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am happily married and have three wonderful children, born in 2004, 2006, and 2009.  
I earned a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan.  I studied 
LWIR semiconductor opto-electronics.  I was raised Presbyterian, was active in Church 
youth group, and a strong Christian believer until roughly 18-20.  My deconversion wasn't
sudden like so many others, but was gradual.  I think this gradual process was partly 
responsible for the fact that I never had an "angry atheist" phase.  
</p>
<p> I stopped believing in the Christian God <b>long</b> before I discovered Christopher 
Hitchens, <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/">Richard Dawkins</a>, or 
<a href="https://www.samharris.org/">Sam Harris</a>. In fact, I was something of an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism">apatheist</a> for decades.  I only 
began to take an interest in the atheist community when I realized that I needed to have
clear and age-appropriate explanations for my beliefs when my children got old enough to 
ask.          
</p>   
<p>
I enjoy discussing epistemology.  It's my intention to 
engage in a positive way with believers of unsubstantiated superstition.  In recent 
years, I've engaged with Christians, Muslims, Flat Earthers, Creationists, anti-vaxers, 
anti-GMO / organic believers, etc.  I try to remain respectful and ask honest questions
to help clarify the belief. I'm generally not in the discussion to "win", but rather to 
help explain the value of evidence.
